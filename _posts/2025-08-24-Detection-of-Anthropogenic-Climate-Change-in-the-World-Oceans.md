## 1. Thesis of Article
Large-scale increases in the heat content of the world’s oceans have been
observed to occur over the last 45 years. The horizontal and temporal character
of these changes has been closely replicated by the state-of-the-art Parallel
Climate Model (PCM) forced by observed and estimated anthropogenic gases.
<span style="background-color:red">**Application of optimal detection methodology shows that the model-produced
signals are indistinguishable from the observations at the 0.05 confidence level. Further, the chances of either the anthropogenic or observed signals being produced by the PCM as a result of natural, internal forcing alone are less than 5%.**</span> This suggests that the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system. Additionally, the requirement that modeled ocean heat uptakes match observations puts a strong, new constraint on anthropogenically forced climate models. It is unknown if the current generation of climate models, other than the PCM, meet this constraint.

## 2. Summary
Many rigorous studies had used air temperature observation as the dataset for finding impact of anthropogenic forcing in those days. Near-surface air temperature, changes in sea ice, and the vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere were also widely used while ocean temperature at depth was not. In this study, they showed at least one global climate model has reproduced the observed change in ocean heat content with high accruracy.

The heat content of the upper 3000m of water column over last 45 years were used as ground dataset. Barnett filtered out noise associated with eddies and interannual or decadal natural variability by using decadal averages. Parallel Climate Model(PCM) forced by observed and estimated concentrations of ghg and sulfate aerosols computed five different simulations, compared to 300 year control run. We can observe PCM produced changes in heat content in each of the major oceans over the last 45 years that are highly similar to those observed.

**Figure 1:** . Decadal values of anomalous heat content (1022 J) in various ocean basins. The heavy dashed line is from observations, and the solid line is the average from five realizations of the PCM forced by observed and estimated anthropogenic forcing. Both curves show significant warming in all basins since the 1950s. The shaded bands denote one (heavy shading) and two (light shading) standard deviations about the model mean signal estimated from the standard deviation in the scatter of the five-member ensemble. The heat content is computed over the upper 3000 m of the water column. The space/time sampling was identical for both model and observations. Basin averages for the northern oceans are defined between 60°N and the equator. The southern ocean averages are between the equator and 77°S. (Adapted from Barnett, 2001)


The vertical development of the oceanic warming signal is shown in Figure 2. Also, the temporal evolution of the model's vertical temperature structure is compared with observations in Figure 3, for the oceans where data density is highest. Barnett emphasized the region of maximal signal strength and applied the model-derived significance factors, which is **standard deviation** estimated from the scatter among the five model realizations, used in Figure 2 to filter noise. The penetration of warming with time and depth is similar between model and observations. However, there are discrepancies in near-surface behavior and the study group assumed that these are due to the large interannual and decadal variability that the model, running with no real-world input, cannot be expected to capture. The model also contains no natural external forcings such as solar or volcanic mechanisms.

**Figure 2:**. Decadal temperature anomalies (°C) in various ocean basins since 1870 from the PCM. Gray-shaded regions indicate signals statistically distinguishable from zero. The timing of the warming, as well as its vertical structure, varies substantially among the basins. The deep changes in the “World”
oceans are seen to be derived solely from changes in the Atlantic. The contour interval is 0.05°C.(Adapted from Barnett, 2001)

**Figure 3:**. Modeled and observed temporal and vertical changes in the temperature in the upper 2000 m of the data-rich North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Near the surface, where interannual and decadal changes and external forcings strongly affect the thermal structure, any agreement is largely
due to chance. Grayshaded regions denote areas where changes are statistically different from zero. The
model broadly reproduces the main features of the vertical structure and its temporal evolution over
the last 40 years. The contour interval is 0.05°C. (Adapted from Barnett, 2001)


Barnnet examined whether the model-produced changes in ocean heat content are different from those expected by chance, e.g., different from those expected in a long control run of the PCM.(Detection)
They further examined whether the model-produced changes are statistically consistent with the observations.(Attribution of anthropogenic forcing)


The method they used is called **"optimal detection"** whose basic idea is to compute the space/time pattern of change predicted by the model-the anthropogenic fingerprint-and its strength. Normalizationi of the data before estimating these signals by the natrual variability or noise, determined from one of two PCM control runs, is necessary for "optimal" detection. The space/time distribution of the observations are projected onto this “fingerprint,” and the observed pattern strength estimated. We then used the second PCM control run (270 years long) to estimate the level of expected natural variability under conditions where no anthropogenic forcing exists. This latter information allows us to estimate a confidence level on the observations and thus make significance statements about difference between the observed signal strength and the model-predicted signal strength.


They also used nonoptimal analysis so that both control runs can be used to estimate levels of natrual variability. The signal strength of this pattern from each of the five realizations and their mean value are shown in Figrue 4. The confidence limits do not include the origin, so the mean of the anthropogenic runs is highly significant and detection of a climate change signal in the model has occurred. Also, the difference between the various model and the observed state all fall within the confidence limits, so that we cannot distinguish between any of the five realizations or the observations.

**Figure 4:**. Detection and attribution diagram. The strength of the anthropogenic pattern of model-predicted changes in depth-averaged ocean temperatures (°C) is shown for each of the five realizations (+) and their ensemble average ($\bullet$). Also shown is the strength of the modelpredicted signal in the observations (X). The lightly stippled region corresponds to the 95% confidence region, centered on the ensemble average, associated with natural variability as estimated from the PCM control runs. The individual signal-strength estimates for independent 45-year chunks of the control run are indicated ($\star$). All forced runs, their mean, and the observations fall within the 95% confidence region and so are indistinguishable from each other, i.e., the model-produced signal and the observations are “consistent” with each other. The uncertainty region does not include the origin, so that natural variability, as estimated by the model, cannot explain the signal in the observations. The results are for the nonoptimal detection method, but do not differ appreciably from that for the full optimal approach. (Adapted from Barnett, 2001)


There are some limits in this study. The observational data are sparse in the southern oceans before the 1980s. They tried to overcome this by subsampling model data only where comparable observations occurred. Also, the estimates of natrual variability used in the detection work were derived from simulations, not observations. In addition, the forced runs they used for detection did not include indirect sulfate, ozone, black aerosols, and othe anthropogenic factors, nor did they include external forcing due to solar variability and volcanic activity. To be more complete analysis, they should consider full three dimensional structure of the signal and nois fields.


<span style="background-color:red">The most important aspect of this work is that it estabilishes a strong constraint on the performance and veracity of anthropogenically forced climate models.</span> For example, a climate model that reproduces the observed change in global air temperature but fails to quantitatively reproduce the observed changed in ocean heat content, cannot be correct.

## Overview

"Detection of Anthropogenic Climate Change in the World's Oceans" presents compelling evidence for a human influence on climate change by examining the heat content of the global oceans. The study found that large-scale increases in the heat content of the world's oceans over the past 45 years have been accurately replicated by the Parallel Climate Model (PCM) when forced with observed and estimated anthropogenic gases. Through the use of optimal detection methodology, the study determined that the signals produced by the model are statistically indistinguishable from the observations at a 0.05 confidence level. This suggests that the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing. The study also notes that the chances of either the observed or anthropogenic signals being produced by the PCM from natural, internal forcing alone are less than 5%. According to the authors, this work broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system.
