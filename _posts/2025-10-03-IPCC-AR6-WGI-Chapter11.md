# 0. Executive Summary
This chapter from the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) evaluates changes in weather and climate extremes. It is an **established fact** that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have increased the frequency and/or intensity of some extremes, particularly for temperature, since pre-industrial times. Evidence has strengthened since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) for changes in extreme precipitation, droughts, tropical cyclones, and compound events. It is now understood that some recent hot extremes would have been **extremely unlikely to occur without human influence** on the climate system.

Regional changes in the intensity and frequency of these extremes generally scale with **global warming**. Even small incremental increases in global warming (e.g., $+0.5^{\circ}C$) cause statistically significant changes in extremes on a global scale (*high confidence*). The occurrence of events **unprecedented** in the observed record will rise with increasing global warming, even at $1.5^{\circ}C$.

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 What Are Extreme Events and How are Their Changes Studied?
Building on the SREX report and AR5, this Report defines an **extreme weather event** as 'an event that is rare at a particular place and time of year', and an **extreme climate event** as 'a pattern of extreme weather that persists for some time, such as a season'. The definitions of ‘**rare**’ are wide ranging, depending on applications. Some studies consider an event as an extreme if it is **unprecedented**; other studies consider events that occur several times a year as moderate extreme events. Rarity of an event with a fixed magnitude also changes under human-induced climate change, making events that are unprecedented so far rather probable under present conditions, but unique in the observational record – and thus often considered as ‘**surprises**’. To study these events, scientists define **thresholds** for extremes that can be either **relative** (e.g., the 90th percentile) or **absolute** (e.g., a temperature of $35^{\circ}C$).

## 1.2 Effects of Greenhouse Gas and Other External Forcings on Extremes
At the global scale, and also at the regional scale to some extent, many of the changes in extremes are a direct consequence of enhanced **radiative forcing**, and the associated **global warming** and/or resultant increase in the **water-holding capacity** of the atmosphere, as well as changes in vertical stability and meridional temperature gradients that affect climate dynamics.

Extreme temperatures on land tend to increase more than the global mean temperature. This is due in large part to the **land–sea warming contrast**, and additionally to regional feedbacks in some regions. The increase in the **intensity** of temperature extremes scales robustly, and in general linearly, with global warming. In contrast, the **frequency** of hot temperature extremes, the number of heatwave days, and the length of heatwave seasons in various regions scale nonlinearly with global mean temperature, often because of threshold effects.

Since AR5, event attribution studies have provided clear evidence that **greenhouse gases** and other **external forcings** have affected individual extreme weather events. However, many highly impactful extreme weather events have not been studied in the **event attribution framework**, particularly in the developing world, due to a lack of observational data and reliable climate models.

## 1.3 Effects of Large-scale Circulation on Changes in Extremes
The response of **large-scale circulation patterns** to external forcing can cascade to uncertainty in the response of extremes to those forcings. For example, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences precipitation, favoring droughts in some regions and heavy rains in others. There has been a **very likely widening of the Hadley circulation** since the 1980s, and the **extratropical jets and cyclone tracks** have **likely been shifting poleward** over the same period. This poleward expansion affects drought occurrence and shifts the tracks of tropical cyclones and storms. Although it is very likely that the amplitude of **ENSO variability** will not robustly change over the 21st century, the frequency of extreme ENSO events, defined by precipitation threshold, is projected to increase with global warming.

Ultimately, large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns are important drivers for local and regional extremes. However, there is overall *low confidence* about future changes in the magnitude, frequency, and spatial distribution of these patterns, which contributes to uncertainty in projected responses of extremes, especially in the near term.

## 1.4 Effects of Regional-scale Processes and Forcings and Feedbacks on Changes in Extremes
At the local and regional scales, changes in extremes are strongly modulated by **local and regional feedbacks**, changes in large-scale circulation patterns, and **regional forcings** such as changes in land use or aerosol concentrations.

The effects of **land-use forcing** may be particularly relevant in the context of low-emissions scenarios, which include large land-use modifications, for instance those associated with the expansion of biofuels, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or re-/afforestation to ensure negative emissions, as well as with the expansion of food production.

**Aerosol forcing** also has a strong regional footprint. From the 1950s to 1980s, aerosol-induced cooling delayed the timing of a significant human contribution to record-breaking heat extremes in some regions. However, the decreased aerosol loading since the 1990s has led to an accelerated warming of hot extremes in some regions like Western Europe.

Additionally, effects of **land surface conditions** on circulation patterns have also been reported. There are also feedbacks between soil moisture content and precipitation occurrence, generally characterized by negative spatial feedbacks and positive local feedbacks. In the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, the **snow- and ice-albedo feedback**, along with other factors, is projected to largely amplify temperature increases.

Finally, extreme events may also regionally **amplify one another**. For example, this is the case for **heatwaves and droughts**, with high temperatures and stronger radiative forcing leading to drying tendencies on land due to increased evapotranspiration, and drier soils then inducing decreased evapotranspiration and higher sensible heat flux and hot temperatures.

In summary, regional forcings and feedbacks – in particular those associated with land use and aerosol forcings – and soil-moisture–temperature, soil moisture–precipitation, and snow/ice–albedo–temperature feedbacks, play an important role in modulating regional changes in extremes. These can also lead to a higher warming of extreme temperatures compared to mean temperature (*high confidence*), and possibly cooling in some regions (*medium confidence*). However, there is only *medium confidence* in the representation of the associated processes in state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs).

# 2. Data and Methods
## 2.1 Definition of Extremes
In the literature, an event is generally considered extreme if the value of a variable exceeds (or lies below) a **threshold**. This threshold can be **relative** (e.g., the number of days when maximum daily temperature is above the 90th percentile for that calendar day over a base period) or **absolute** (e.g., the number of days in which maximum daily temperature is above $35^{\circ}C$).

Changes in extremes have also been examined from two perspectives: changes in the **frequency** for a given magnitude of extremes, or changes in the **magnitude** for a particular return period (frequency). Changes in the probability of extremes (e.g., temperature extremes) depend on the rarity of the extreme event that is assessed, with a larger change in probability associated with a rarer event. However, changes in the magnitude, represented by the return levels of the extreme events, may not be as sensitive to the rarity of the event.

The sensitivity of changes in extremes to increasing global warming is also dependent on the definition of the considered extremes.
* When similar damage occurs once a fixed threshold is exceeded, it is more important to ask a question regarding changes in the **frequency**. But when the exceedance of this fixed threshold becomes a normal occurrence in the future, this can lead to a saturation in the change of probability.
* If the impact of an event increases with the intensity of the event, it would be more relevant to examine changes in the **magnitude**.

Finally, **adaptation** to climate change might change the relevant thresholds over time, although such aspects are still rarely integrated into assessments.

## 2.2 Data
A robust determination of long-term changes in extreme events requires high-quality data over long periods. In general, it is more difficult to determine long-term changes for events of fairly large temporal duration, such as **‘megadroughts’** that last several years or longer, because of the limitations of the **observational sample size**.

Extreme indices computed from various **reanalysis data products** have been used in some studies, but reanalysis extreme statistics have not been rigorously compared to observations. There is often lower agreement across reanalysis datasets for extreme precipitation, especially in regions with sparse observations.

**Satellite remote sensing data** have been used to provide information about precipitation extremes because several products provide data at sub-daily resolution for precipitation and clouds. However, satellites do not observe the primary atmospheric state variables directly, and polar-orbiting satellites do not observe any given place at all times. Hence, their utility as a substitute for high-frequency (i.e., daily) ground-based observations is limited.

## 2.3 Attribution of Extremes
Attribution science identifies the causes for changes in the climate system. One method, **optimal fingerprinting**, faces specific challenges when applied to the detection and attribution of trends in extremes and on regional scales where the lower signal-to-noise ratio is a challenge. In particular, the method generally requires the data to follow a Normal (Gaussian) distribution, which is often not the case for extremes. However, recent studies showed that extremes can be transformed to a Gaussian distribution, for example, by averaging over space, so that optimal fingerprinting techniques can still be used. Non-stationary extreme value distributions, which allow for the detailed detection and attribution of regional trends in temperature extremes, have also been used.

A more commonly used approach is the **'probability-based approach'** (also called the 'risk-based approach'), which produces statements such as ‘anthropogenic climate change made this event type twice as likely’ or ‘anthropogenic climate change made this event 15% more intense’. This is done by estimating probability distributions of the index characterizing the event in today’s climate, as well as in a counterfactual climate without human influence, and either comparing intensities for a given occurrence probability (e.g., a 1-in-100-year event) or probabilities for a given magnitude. This method encompasses various analytical techniques, building on observations, statistical analyses, climate models (regional and global), and large ensembles. A key component in any event attribution analysis is the level of **conditioning on the state of the climate system**.

More **conditional approaches** involve prescribing certain aspects of the climate system, from sea surface temperature patterns to large-scale atmospheric circulation. These highly conditional approaches have also been called **‘storylines’** and can be useful when applied to extreme events that are too rare to otherwise analyze, or where the specific atmospheric conditions were central to the impact. These methods are also used to enable the use of very high-resolution simulations in cases where lower-resolution models do not simulate the regional atmospheric dynamics well. However, the imposed conditions limit an overall assessment of the anthropogenic influence on an event, as the fixed aspects of the analysis may also have been affected by climate change. Combining conditional assessments of changes in the intensity with a multi-model approach should be performed, since storylines alone preclude any attribution statement about the change in frequency.

The **storyline approach** provides an alternative option that does not depend on the model’s ability to represent the circulation reliably. For the unconditional **probability-based approach**, multi-model and multi-approach (e.g., combining observational analyses and model experiments) methods have been used to improve the robustness of event attribution.


## 2.4 Projecting Changes in Extremes as a Function of Global Warming Levels

[Figure 11.8]

The most important quantity for characterizing past and future climate change is **global warming** relative to its pre-industrial level. These changes in global warming are linked quasi-linearly to cumulative **carbon dioxide emissions**.

The assessment of projections of future changes in extremes as a function of **global warming levels (GWLs)** has an advantage in **separating uncertainty** associated with the global warming response (e.g., how sensitive the climate is) from the uncertainty resulting from the **regional climate response** as a function of GWLs. If the interest is in the projection of regional changes at certain GWLs, such as those defined by the Paris Agreement, projections based on **time periods and emissions scenarios** have unnecessarily larger uncertainty. This is due to differences in model global **transient climate responses** (i.e., how fast different models warm). To take advantage of this feature, assessments of projected changes in this chapter are largely provided in relation to future GWLs, with a focus on changes at **$+1.5^{\circ}C$, $+2.0^{\circ}C$, and $+4.0^{\circ}C$** of global warming above pre-industrial levels.

While regional changes in many types of extremes do scale robustly with global surface temperature, generally irrespective of emissions scenarios, effects of **local forcing** can distort this relation. For example, emissions scenarios with the same radiative forcing can have different regional extreme precipitation responses resulting from different **aerosol forcing**. Climate models often either overestimate or underestimate observed changes in annual maximum daily maximum temperature, depending on the region. Part of these discrepancies may be due to the lack of representation of some **land forcings**, in particular **crop intensification and irrigation**. Since these local forcings are not represented, and their future changes are difficult to project, these can be important caveats when using GWL scaling to project future changes for these regions. However, these caveats also apply to the use of scenario-based projections.

The **temporal dimension**—that is, *when* the given GWL occurs—also matters for projections, in particular beyond the 21st century, and for some climate variables related to components of the climate system associated with **large inertia** (e.g., sea level rise).

An important question is the identification of the GWL at which a given change in a climate extreme can begin to **emerge from climate noise**. As Figure 11.8 shows, signals for hot extremes (TXx) **emerge very early**, often **below $0.2^{\circ}C$ in many regions** and at **around $0.5^{\circ}C$ in most regions**. This confirms conclusions from the SR1.5 report, which showed that a *difference* as small as **$0.5^{\circ}C$ of global warming**—for example, the increment *between* a $+1.5^{\circ}C$ and a $+2.0^{\circ}C$ GWL—leads to **detectable differences** in temperature extremes in most WGI AR6 regions.

In essence, this approach "replaces" the time dimension with the GWL. The **physical response** of many extremes is more directly and reliably tied to the *level* of warming (the GWL) than the *year* it occurs. The regional pattern of change at a $+2.0^{\circ}C$ GWL is expected to be very similar, regardless of which emissions scenario gets us there. This allows researchers to **separate the problem** into two almost-independent questions:
1.  **The Impacts Question (GWL-based):** What will the regional climate look like *at* $+2.0^{\circ}C$?
2.  **The Timing Question (Scenario-based):** *When* will we *reach* $+2.0^{\circ}C$?

# 3. Temperature Extremes

This section assesses changes in temperature extremes, focusing on the **magnitude and frequency** of events ranging from **moderate** (occurring several times a year) to **very extreme** (occurring once in 10 or more years). The assessment covers timescales from a single day to a full season.

## 3.1 Mechanisms and Drivers

**Greenhouse gas forcing** is the **dominant factor** driving the increases in the intensity, frequency, and duration of **warm extremes** and the decrease in **cold extremes**. This general global-scale warming is modulated by large-scale **atmospheric circulation patterns**, regional **feedbacks** (like soil moisture–temperature and snow/ice–albedo), and **local forcings** (like land-use change or aerosols) at regional and local scales.

**Mid-latitude planetary wave modulations** affect short-duration extremes like heatwaves. These **large-scale modes of variability** (e.g., ENSO, PNA) impact the strength and persistence of meteorological patterns that cause extremes. Even after accounting for these modes, a large portion of the multi-decadal change in extreme temperature remains and **can be attributed to human influence**.

**Land-atmosphere feedbacks** strongly modulate regional and local-scale changes in temperature extremes (*high confidence*). This effect is particularly notable in mid-latitude regions where the **drying of soil moisture amplifies high temperatures**, especially through increases in sensible heat flux. Soil moisture-temperature feedbacks affect past and present-day heatwaves in observations and model simulations, both locally and beyond the regions of feedback occurrence through changes in regional circulation patterns. The decrease of plant transpiration or the increase of stomata resistance under enhanced **$CO_2$ concentrations** is a direct $CO_2$ forcing of land temperatures (warming due to reduced evaporative cooling), which contributes to higher warming on land. The **snow/ice-albedo feedback** plays an important role in amplifying temperature variability in the high latitudes and can be the **largest contributor** to the rapid warming of cold extremes in the mid-and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

**Regional external forcings**, including **land-use changes** and emissions of **anthropogenic aerosols**, also play an important role in the changes of temperature extremes in some regions (*high confidence*). **Deforestation** may have contributed to about one-third of the warming of hot extremes in some mid-latitude regions since the pre-industrial time.

These combined factors lead to significant **heterogeneity** in regional changes and their associated uncertainties (*high confidence*).

## 3.2 Observed Trends

The additional observational records, along with a stronger warming signal, show very clearly that changes observed at the time of AR5 continued, providing strengthened evidence of an **increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes** and a **decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes**. While the magnitude of the observed trends in temperature-related extremes varies depending on the region, spatial and temporal scales, and metric assessed, evidence of a **warming effect is overwhelming, robust, and consistent**. In particular, an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes is almost always associated with an increase in the hottest temperatures and in the number of heatwave days.

Warming of land mean **TXx** (annual hottest day) is similar to the mean temperature warming on land, which is about 45% higher than global warming. Warming of land mean **TNn** (annual coldest night) is even higher, with about $3^{\circ}C$ of warming since 1960. Warming trends in temperature extremes globally, and in most land areas, over the past century are also found to be consistent in a range of observation-based datasets, with the extremes related to **daily minimum temperatures changing faster** than those related to daily maximum temperatures. A warming in **warm-season** temperature extremes is detected, even during the 'slower surface global warming' period (late 1990s to early 2010s).

It is *virtually certain* that there has been an **increase in the number of warm days and nights** and a **decrease in the number of cold days and nights** on the global scale since 1950. Both the coldest extremes and hottest extremes display increasing temperatures. It is *very likely* that these changes have also occurred at the regional scale. It is *virtually certain* that there have been **increases in the intensity and duration of heatwaves** and in the number of heatwave days at the global scale. **Annual minimum temperatures** on land have increased about **three times more than global surface temperature** since the 1960s, with particularly strong warming in the **Arctic** (*high confidence*).

[Figure 11.9]

## 3.3 Model Evaluation

The models generally captured trends in the second half of the 20th century for indices of extreme temperature, although AR5 noted they tended to **overestimate trends in hot extremes** and **underestimate trends in cold extremes**.

Compared to GCMs, **RCM (Regional Climate Model) simulations** show an **added value** in simulating temperature-related extremes, though this depends on topographical complexity and the parameters employed.

Some **land forcings** are **not well represented** in climate models. There is *high agreement* that temperate **deforestation** leads to summer warming and winter cooling, which has substantially contributed to the warming of hot extremes in the northern mid-latitudes over the course of the 20th century and in recent years. However, observed **forest effects** on the seasonal and diurnal cycle of temperature are **not well-captured** in several ESMs. Also, **irrigation effects**, which can lead to regional cooling of temperature extremes, are **generally not integrated** in current generations of ESMs.

Climate models can reproduce the mean state and overall warming of temperature extremes observed globally and in most regions (*high confidence*). The ability of models to capture trends depends on the metric evaluated, the way indices are calculated, and the time periods and spatial scales considered.

[Figure 11.10]

## 3.4 Detection and Attribution, Event Attribution

It is *likely* **anthropogenic influences** have led to the warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scales. The AR5 concluded that human influence has *very likely* contributed to the observed changes in the **intensity and frequency of daily temperature extremes** on the global scale in the second half of the 20th century.

Studies of monthly, seasonal, and annual records in various regions and globally show an increase in the **breaking of hot records** and a decrease in the **breaking of cold records**. Changes in **anthropogenically attributable record-breaking rates** are noted to be largest over the Northern Hemisphere land areas.

Human influence is found to have increased the probability of the **historically hottest summers** in many regions of the world, both in terms of mean temperature and **wet bulb globe temperature** (WBGT). Extreme event studies have found an attributable increase in the probability of hot annual and seasonal temperatures in many locations.

For short-duration temperature extremes, several studies for recent events from 2016 onwards have determined an **infinite risk ratio** (a fraction of attributable risk, or FAR, of 1). This indicates that the occurrence probability for such events is close to zero in model simulations *without* anthropogenic influences. Though it is difficult to accurately estimate the lower bound of the uncertainty range of the FAR in these cases, the fact that those events are so far outside the envelope of the models with only natural forcing indicates that it is *extremely unlikely* for those events to occur without human influence.

Different event attribution studies can produce a wide range of changes in the probability of event occurrence because of **different framing**. The temperature **event definition** itself (e.g., its spatial and temporal scale) plays a crucial role in the attributable signal. **Large-scale, longer-duration events** tend to have notably **larger attributable risk ratios** as natural variability is smaller. While uncertainty in the best estimates of the risk ratios may be large, their lower bounds can be quite insensitive to uncertainties in observations or model descriptions, thus increasing confidence in conservative attribution statements.

The relative strength of anthropogenic influences on temperature extremes is **regionally variable**, in part due to differences in changes in atmospheric circulation, land-surface feedbacks, and other external drivers such as aerosols. Despite all of these differences, and larger uncertainties at the regional scale, **nearly all studies** demonstrated that human influence has contributed to an increase in the frequency or intensity of hot extremes and to a decrease in the frequency or intensity of cold extremes.

## 3.5 Projections

[Figure 11.11]

[Figure 11.12]

It is *virtually certain* there will be **more frequent hot extremes** and **fewer cold extremes** at the global scale and over most land areas in a future warmer climate, and it is *very likely* that **heatwaves** will occur with a **higher frequency and longer duration**. New studies since AR5 and SR1.5 confirm these assessments.

Projected changes in the **magnitude** of extreme temperatures over land are **larger than changes in global mean temperature**, over mid-latitude land regions in particular. CMIP6 simulations show that a **$0.5^{\circ}C$ increment** in global warming will **significantly increase** the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and decrease the intensity and frequency of cold extremes on the global scale. It takes **less than half a degree** ($0.5^{\circ}C$) for the changes in TXx (annual hottest day) to **emerge above the level of natural variability**. The 66% uncertainty ranges of the land medians for 10-year or 50-year TXx events **do not overlap between $1.0^{\circ}C$ and $1.5^{\circ}C$** in the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble simulations, highlighting a detectable change. Projected changes in temperature extremes can deviate from projected changes in annual mean warming in the same regions due to the **additional processes** that control regional extremes, including **soil moisture-evapotranspiration-temperature feedbacks** and **snow/ice-albedo-temperature feedbacks**.

The probability of exceeding a certain hot extreme threshold will increase. The changes tend to scale **nonlinearly** with the level of global warming, with **larger changes for more rare events**.

At the middle of the 21st century, 66% of the land surface area would experience the present-day 20-year return values of TXx every other year, on average, under the **RCP8.5** scenario, as opposed to only 34% under **RCP4.5**. This **nonlinear increase in frequency** (when using fixed-threshold indices) as a function of global warming is **consistent with a linear warming** of the absolute temperature of the temperature extremes themselves.

Five RCMs in the **CORDEX-East Asia** region project increases in the 20-year return values of temperature extremes (summer maxima), with models that exhibit warm biases projecting stronger warming. **Empirical statistical downscaling** has also been used to produce more robust estimates for future heatwaves compared to RCMs based on large multi-model ensembles.

In summary, it is *virtually certain* that further increases in the intensity and frequency of **hot extremes**, and decreases in the intensity and frequency of **cold extremes**, will occur throughout the 21st century and around the world. It is *virtually certain* that the **number of hot days and hot nights** and the length, frequency, and/or intensity of **warm spells or heatwaves** (compared to 1995–2014) will **increase** over most land areas. In most regions, changes in the magnitude of temperature extremes are proportional to global warming levels (*high confidence*). The highest increase of temperature of **hottest days** is projected in some **mid-latitude and semi-arid regions**, at about 1.5 to 2 times the rate of global warming (*high confidence*). The highest increase of temperature of **coldest days** is projected in **Arctic regions**, at about **three times the rate** of global warming (*high confidence*). The probability of temperature extremes generally increases **nonlinearly** with increasing global warming levels (*high confidence*). Confidence in assessments depends on the spatial and temporal scales, but there is *high confidence* that, on land, the **magnitude of temperature extremes increases more strongly** than global mean temperature.

# 4. Heavy Precipitation

## 4.1 Mechanisms and Drivers

The primary driver of increases in heavy precipitation is **thermodynamic**: a warmer atmosphere increases its **water-holding capacity** at a rate governed by the **Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relation**. This effect directly results in an increase in extreme precipitation at a similar rate on a global scale. However, at the regional scale, this thermodynamic increase is further modulated by **dynamic changes** (i.e., changes in atmospheric circulation).

These dynamic changes are complex. **Large-scale modes of variability**, such as ENSO or the NAO, modulate precipitation extremes by altering environmental conditions or storm tracks. Furthermore, the very **efficiency** of converting atmospheric moisture into precipitation can change due to cloud microphysical adjustments to warming, which in turn alters the characteristics of extreme precipitation.

A key challenge is that it remains difficult to separate the effect of global warming from internal variability in the *observed* changes of these modes. Consequently, future **projections** of these modes are highly uncertain, which in turn introduces uncertainty into regional projections of extreme precipitation. In addition to circulation patterns, changes in **SSTs** also alter the **land-sea contrast** and subsequently affect precipitation extremes near coastal regions.

Non-GHG forcings also play a role. **Atmospheric aerosols** have a complex effect: decreases in aerosols can lead to warming (a thermodynamic effect that increases extreme precipitation), but changes in aerosols also induce **dynamic changes**, such as in tropical cyclones.

At the local scale, **urbanization** is found to intensify extreme precipitation, especially in the afternoon and early evening, over the urban area and its downwind region (*medium confidence*). Four primary mechanisms are proposed:
* (i) Increases in atmospheric moisture due to convergence from the **urban heat island effect**;
* (ii) Increases in condensation nuclei from **urban aerosol emissions**;
* (iii) Aerosol pollution impacting **cloud microphysics**; and
* (iv) Urban structures physically **impeding atmospheric motion**.
Other local forcings, such as reservoirs, irrigation, and large-scale land-cover change, can also affect local extreme precipitation.

In summary, precipitation extremes are controlled by both **thermodynamic and dynamic processes**. The warming-induced thermodynamic change results in an increase in extreme precipitation at a rate that closely follows the C-C relationship at the global scale (*high confidence*). However, the effects of warming-induced **dynamic changes** are more complicated, difficult to quantify, and remain an uncertain aspect of projections. Precipitation extremes are also affected by non-GHG forcings, including changes in aerosols and land use (*medium confidence*).

## 4.2 Observed Trends

Observational evidence has strengthened since AR5. It is *likely* that the number of heavy precipitation events over land has increased in more regions than it has decreased, though regional variations are wide and trends in many locations are not statistically significant. Several key metrics show significant increases:
* The average **annual maximum 1-day precipitation (Rx1day)** has significantly increased since the mid-20th century over land, in both humid and dry regions.
* Light, moderate, and heavy daily precipitation have all intensified in a gridded daily precipitation dataset.
* The globally averaged annual fraction of precipitation from days in the top 5% (**R95pTOT**) has also significantly increased.
The rate of increase in the magnitude of 20th-century Rx1day is estimated to be consistent with C-C scaling relative to global mean temperature.

A considerable body of literature examines the scaling of **sub-daily precipitation extremes** conditional on day-to-day air or dew-point temperatures. This "apparent scaling" is robustly observed in many regions, often ranging between the C-C and **two-times the C-C rate**. However, this finding must be interpreted with caution. "Apparent scaling" samples *multiple synoptic weather states*, mixing thermodynamic and dynamic factors that are **not directly relevant** to the long-term climate change response. It therefore remains difficult to use knowledge about apparent scaling to infer past and future changes in extreme sub-daily precipitation from observed and projected changes in local temperature.

The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation have *likely* increased at the **global scale** over a majority of land regions with good observational coverage. This increase is also *likely* on the **continental scale** over North America, Europe, and Asia, where observational data are most abundant.

[Figure 11.13]

## 4.3 Model Evaluation

Evaluating climate model competence in simulating heavy precipitation extremes is challenging. A primary difficulty is the **spatial scale mismatch** between simulated and observed data. Simulated precipitation represents an areal mean, whereas station-based observations are point locations and often sparse. Furthermore, the **order of operations** for constructing gridded station-based extreme values (i.e., whether extremes are extracted at the station *before* gridding, or *after* gridding daily values) represents different spatial scales and must be accounted for in model evaluation.

[Figure 11.14]

Despite these challenges, CMIP5 models successfully reproduced an important observed relationship: an **increase in extreme precipitation** occurs at the **cost of a decrease in non-extreme precipitation**. While grid-scale challenges remain, there is *high confidence* in the ability of models to capture the **large-scale spatial distribution** of precipitation extremes over land.

## 4.4 Detection and Attribution, Event Attribution

Detection and attribution analyses have provided consistent and *robust* evidence of **human influence** on extreme precipitation of one- and five-day durations (Rx1day, Rx5day) at global to continental scales. The observed increases in these metrics over the Northern Hemisphere land area (1951–2005) can be attributed to the effect of **combined anthropogenic forcing** (greenhouse gases and aerosols), as simulated by CMIP5 models, with the rate of intensification being consistent with C-C scaling.

Most of the observed intensification of heavy precipitation over land regions is *likely* due to **anthropogenic influence**, with greenhouse gas emissions as the main contributor. New and *robust* evidence has strengthened this conclusion since AR5. This includes attribution of observed increases in Rx1day and Rx5day, attribution of the increase in the fraction of annual precipitation falling in heavy events, and the observation that a larger fraction of land shows enhanced extreme precipitation and a higher probability of record-breaking one-day precipitation than expected by chance—all of which can **only be explained** when anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing is considered.

## 4.5 Projections

The AR5 concluded that it is *very likely* that extreme precipitation events will be more frequent and more intense over most of the mid-latitude land masses and wet tropics in a warmer world.

Newer CMIP5 and CMIP6 models project that the rate of increase in Rx1day with warming is **independent of the forcing scenario** or forcing mechanism. For extreme precipitation that occurs once a year or less frequently, the magnitudes of the rates of change per $1^{\circ}C$ of global mean temperature are similar, regardless of whether the warming is caused by $CO_2$, $CH_4$, solar forcing, or $SO_4$ aerosols.

This scenario-independence means that even a **small increment** of global warming, such as **$0.5^{\circ}C$**, can result in a **significant increase** in extreme precipitation. Projections also show that changes in long-period return values (e.g., 50-year events) are larger than changes in the mean (e.g., 1-year events), with **larger relative changes for more rare events**.

[Figure 11.15]

The **spatial patterns** of the projected changes are quite similar across different warming levels, as shown in Figure 11.16, confirming a near-linear scaling between extreme precipitation and GWLs at regional scales. Extreme precipitation **nearly always increases across land areas**, with larger increases at higher GWLs. The *very likely* ranges of the multi-model ensemble changes for 50-year return values (Rx1day and Rx5day) between $1.0^{\circ}C$ and $1.5^{\circ}C$ warming levels are **above zero for all continents except Europe** (which is *likely* above zero). Projected decreases in extreme precipitation are confined mostly to **subtropical ocean areas** and are highly correlated with decreases in mean precipitation due to storm track shifts.

Projected increases in the **probability (frequency)** of extreme precipitation (of a fixed magnitude) are **nonlinear**, showing **larger increases for more rare events**.
* **CMIP5** simulations show the frequency of a present-day 20-year event is projected to increase by 10% at $1.5^{\circ}C$ GWL and 22% at $2.0^{\circ}C$ GWL. A present-day 100-year event is projected to increase by 20% at $1.5^{\circ}C$ and over 45% at $2.0^{\circ}C$.
* **CMIP6** simulations (SSP scenarios) project that the frequency of 10-year and 50-year events will be approximately **doubled and tripled**, respectively, at a very high warming level of $4^{\circ}C$.

For very short-duration events, a majority of the available **convection-permitting simulations** project increases in the intensities of extreme **sub-daily precipitation events**, with the amount of increase similar to or **higher than the C-C scaling rate**.

[Figure 11.16]

In summary, heavy precipitation will generally become **more frequent and more intense** with additional global warming. At a global warming level of $4^{\circ}C$ relative to the pre-industrial, very rare (e.g., one in 10 or more years) heavy precipitation events would become more frequent and more intense than in the recent past, on the global scale (*virtually certain*), and in all continents and AR6 regions. The increase in frequency and intensity is *extremely likely* for most continents and *very likely* for most AR6 regions. At the global scale, the **intensification** (change in magnitude) of heavy precipitation will follow the rate of increase in atmospheric moisture (*high confidence*), about **7% per $1^{\circ}C$** of global warming. The increase in the **frequency** of heavy precipitation events will be **non-linear** with more warming and will be **higher for rarer events** (*high confidence*), with 10- and 50-year events projected to be approximately **double and triple**, respectively, at the $4^{\circ}C$ warming level. Increases in the intensity of extreme precipitation events at regional scales will depend on the amount of regional warming as well as changes in atmospheric circulation and storm dynamics, leading to regional differences in the rate of heavy precipitation changes (*high confidence*).

# 5. Compound Events

The SREX (2012) first defined **compound events** as: (i) two or more extreme events occurring simultaneously or successively; (ii) combinations of extreme events with underlying conditions that amplify the impact; or (iii) combinations of events that are not themselves extremes but lead to an extreme event or impact when combined. This assessment uses a broad definition: 'the **combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards** that contributes to societal or environmental risk'. This definition focuses on the risk framework and highlights that compound events may not necessarily result from dependent drivers.

Compound events have been classified into four main types:
* **Preconditioned events:** A weather- or climate-driven precondition aggravates the impacts of a climatic impact-driver (e.g., drought preconditioning a heatwave).
* **Multivariate events:** Multiple drivers and/or climatic impact-drivers lead to an impact (e.g., concurrent hot and dry conditions).
* **Temporally compounding events:** A succession of hazards leads to an impact (e.g., multiple storms in a row).
* **Spatially compounding events:** Hazards in multiple connected locations cause an aggregated impact (e.g., simultaneous crop failures in different breadbaskets).

In this context, **Drivers** are the climate processes and variables (spanning multiple scales), while **Hazards** (also termed 'climatic impact-drivers') are the immediate physical precursors to negative impacts (e.g., floods, heatwaves, wildfires).

## 5.1 Overview

Compound events can lead to **extreme impacts** that are much larger than the sum of the impacts from individual extremes alone. This is because multiple stressors can exceed the **coping capacity** of a system more quickly. The contributing events can be of similar types (e.g., clustered storms) or of different types. Concomitant extreme conditions at different locations become more probable as changes in climate extremes are emerging over an increasing fraction of the land area.

Impacts may occur because of large **multivariate anomalies**, even if the individual variables are not extreme in a univariate assessment. For instance, ecosystems are typically adapted to the local **covariability** of temperature and precipitation, so a bivariate anomaly (e.g., warmer *and* drier than normal) may have a large impact, even if the temperature or precipitation alone is not a record. It should be noted, however, that multi-hazard dependencies can also **decrease risk**, for instance when hazards are negatively correlated (e.g., conditions for extreme snow and extreme wildfire).

## 5.2 Concurrent Extremes in Coastal and Estuarine Regions

**Sea level extremes** and their physical impacts in the coastal zone arise from a complex set of atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial processes (e.g., storm surge, high tides, river runoff) that interact on a range of scales. These interactions, which can lead to **compound flooding**, will be modified by a changing climate, most notably through **sea level rise**. At the global scale and under a high-emissions scenario, the concurrence probability of meteorological conditions driving compound flooding is projected to **increase by more than 25%**, on average, along coastlines worldwide by 2100, compared to the present.

## 5.3 Concurrent Droughts and Heatwaves

Over most land regions, temperature and precipitation are strongly **negatively correlated** during summer. This is partly due to **land-atmosphere feedbacks** (drier soils lead to higher sensible heat flux and thus higher temperatures) and also because the **synoptic-scale weather systems** (e.g., blocking high-pressure systems) that are favourable for extreme heat are also unfavourable for rain. This physical link leads to a strong correlation between **droughts and heatwaves**.

There is *high confidence* that concurrent **heatwaves and droughts** have **increased in frequency** over the last century at the global scale, and that this increase is due to **human influence**.

## n.1 Box | Thermodynamic and Dynamic Changes in Extreme Across Scales
A key concept for understanding how extremes are changing is the distinction between thermodynamic and dynamic processes.

>Changes in weather and climate extremes are determined by local exchanges in heat, moisture, and other related quantities (**thermodynamic changes**) and those associated with atmospheric and oceanic motions (**dynamic changes**). While thermodynamic and dynamic processes are interconnected, considering them separately helps to disentangle the roles of different processes contributing to changes in climate extremes.
>
>* **Temperature Extremes**
>    The **water vapour feedback** always amplifies the initial temperature increases (positive feedback), while the **lapse rate feedback** (change in the vertical profile of temperature) amplifies near-surface temperature increases (positive feedback) in mid- and high latitudes but reduces temperature increases (negative feedback) in tropical regions. Thermodynamic responses and feedbacks also occur through surface processes. For instance, observations and model simulations show that temperature increases, including extreme temperatures, are amplified in areas where seasonal snow cover is reduced due to decreases in surface albedo. In some mid-latitude areas, temperature increases are amplified by the higher atmospheric evaporative demand that results in a drying of soils in some regions, leading to increased sensible heat fluxes (**soil-moisture–temperature feedback**). Other thermodynamic feedback processes include changes in the water-use efficiency of plants under enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) concentrations that can reduce the overall transpiration, and thus also enhance temperature in projections. Changes in the spatial distribution of temperatures can also affect temperature extremes by modifying the characteristics of weather patterns. For example, a robust thermodynamic effect of **polar amplification** is a weakened north-south temperature gradient, which amplifies the warming of cold extremes in the Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes because of the reduction of cold air advection.
>
>* **Precipitation Extremes**
>    Changes in temperature also control changes in water vapour through increases in evaporation and in the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere. At the global scale, column-integrated water vapour content increases roughly following the **Clausius–Clapeyron (C-C) relation**, with an increase of approximately 7% per $1^{\circ}C$ of global-mean surface warming. Nonetheless, at regional scales, water vapour increases differ from this C-C rate due to several reasons, including a change in weather regimes and limitations in moisture transport from the ocean, which warms more slowly than land. Observational studies have shown that the observed rate of increased precipitation extremes is similar to the C-C rate at the global scale. Climate model projections show that the increase in water vapour leads to robust increases in precipitation extremes everywhere, with a magnitude that varies between 4% and 8% per $1^{\circ}C$ of surface warming (thermodynamic contribution). At regional scales, climate models show that the dynamic contribution can be substantial and strongly modify the projected rate of change of extreme precipitation, with large regions in the subtropics showing robust reductions and other areas (e.g., equatorial Pacific) showing robust amplifications. Dynamic contributions can occur in response to changes in the vertical and horizontal distribution of temperature (thermodynamics) and can affect the frequency and intensity of synoptic and subsynoptic phenomena, including tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, fronts, mesoscale-convective systems and thunderstorms. For example, the poleward shift and strengthening of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude storm tracks can modify the frequency or intensity of extreme precipitation. However, the precise way in which dynamic changes will affect precipitation extremes is unclear due to several competing effects. The extra latent heat released within storms has been shown to increase precipitation extremes by strengthening convective updrafts and the intensity of the cyclonic circulation. As these dynamic effects result from feedback processes within storms where convective processes are crucial, their proper representation might require improving the horizontal/vertical resolution, the formulation of parametrizations, or both, in current climate models.
>
>* **Droughts**
>    Thermodynamic processes affect droughts by increasing **atmospheric evaporative demand** through changes in air temperature, radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity. Dynamic processes affect droughts through changes in the occurrence, duration and intensity of weather anomalies, which are related to precipitation and the amount of sunlight.
>
>In summary, both thermodynamic and dynamic processes are involved in the changes of extremes in response to warming. Anthropogenic forcing (e.g., increases in greenhouse gas concentrations) directly affects thermodynamic variables, including overall increases in high temperatures and atmospheric evaporative demand, and regional changes in atmospheric moisture, which intensify heatwaves, droughts and heavy precipitation events when they occur (*high confidence*). Dynamic processes are often indirect responses to thermodynamic changes, are strongly affected by internal climate variability, and are also less well understood. As such, there is *low confidence* in how dynamic changes affect the location and magnitude of extreme events in a warming climate.

## n.2 Box | Changes in Low-likelihood, High-impact Extremes
Climate science must also contend with the challenge of unanticipated events that, while improbable, could have exceptionally severe impacts.

>Unanticipated **Low-likelihood, high-impact (LLHI) events** can either result from **tipping points** in the climate system, such as the shutdown of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation or the drydown of the Amazonian rainforest, or from uncertainties in climate processes, including climate feedbacks, that may enhance or damp extremes. The low confidence does not by itself exclude the possibility of such events occuring; rather, it indicates a poor state of knowledge.
>
>There are some events that are sufficiently rare that they have not been observed in meteorological records, but whose occurrence is nonetheless plausible within the current state of the climate system. The rare nature of such events and the limited availability of relevant data makes it difficult to estimate their occurrence probability and thus gives little evidence on whether to include such hypothetical events in planning decisions and risk assessments. Additionally, there is also a limitation of available resources to exhaust all plausible trajectories of the climate system. As a result, there will still be events that cannot be anticipated. These events can be surprises to many in that the events have not been experienced, although their occurrence could be inferred by statistical means or physical modelling approaches.
>
>Another approach consists in using physical climate models to create a physically self-consistent **storyline** of plausible extreme events and assessing their impacts and driving factors in past or future conditions. Attributing and projecting very rare events in a particular location by assessing their likelihood of occurrence within the same larger region and climate thus provides another way to make quantitative assessments regarding events that are extremely rare locally.
>
>One factor making such events hard to anticipate is the fact that we now live in a **non-stationary climate**, and that the framework of reference for adaptation is continuously moving. Furthermore, when other aspects of the risk, vulnerability, and exposure are historically high or have recently increased, relatively moderate extremes can have very high impacts. Another factor making events high-impact and difficult to anticipate is that several locations under moderate warming levels could be affected simultaneously, or very repeatedly by different types of extremes. Therefore, in order to estimate whether, and at what level of global warming, very high impacts arising from extremes would occur, the spatial extent of extremes and the potential of **compounding extremes** need to be assessed.
>
>**Compound events**, including concurrent extremes, are a factor increasing the probability of LLHI events (*high confidence*). With increasing global warming, some compound events with low likelihood in past and current climate will become more frequent, and there is a higher chance of historically unprecedented events and **surprises** (*high confidence*). However, even extreme events that do not have a particularly low probability in the present climate (at more than $1^{\circ}C$ of global warming) can be perceived as surprises because of the pace of global warming (*high confidence*).

# n. Cross Chapter Box
## n.1 Translating Between Regional Information at GWL versus Scenarios for End Users

[Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Figure 1]

> ### Background
> **GWLs** are expressed as changes in global surface temperature relative to the **1850–1900 period**. Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Figure 1 illustrates how the assessment of the climate response at GWLs relates to the **uncertainty in scenarios** regarding the *timing* of those GWLs, as well as to the uncertainty in the associated regional climate responses (including extremes and other climatic impact-drivers (CIDs)). For many (but not all) climate variables and CIDs, the **response pattern** for a given GWL is **consistent across different scenarios**.
>
> The regional response patterns at a given GWL have been found to be consistent across different scenarios for many climate variables. This consistency tends to be **higher for temperature-related variables** than for variables in the hydrological cycle or those characterizing atmospheric dynamics, and for intermediate- to high-emissions scenarios than for low-emissions scenarios. The response pattern is also found to be **broadly consistent** between models that reach a GWL relatively early (a high warming rate) and those that reach it later (a low warming rate) under a given SSP.
>
> The use of GWLs as a dimension of integration **does not require linearity** in the response of a climate variable. It is therefore useful even for metrics that do not show a linear response, such as the **frequency of heat extremes** over land and oceans, as long as the relationship of the variable of interest to the GWL is **scenario independent**. This means the response is independent of the *pathway* and the relative contribution of various radiative forcings.
>
> The limited scenario dependence of the GWL-based response for many variables implies that the regional response to emissions scenarios can be split into two almost **independent contributions**: (i) the **transient global warming response** to scenarios (i.e., the global sensitivity) and (ii) the **regional response as a function of a given GWL**, which is also referred to as ‘regional climate sensitivity’. Analyses of the CMIP6 and CMIP5 multi-model ensembles show that the GWL-based responses are very similar for temperature and precipitation extremes across the ensembles, despite their differences in global warming response. This confirms a **substantial decoupling** between the two responses (global warming vs GWL-based regional response) for these variables. Thus, the GWL approach **isolates the uncertainty** in the regional climate response from the global warming uncertainty induced by the scenario, the global mean model response, and internal variability.
>
> [CCB 11.1, Figure 2]
>
> ### Mapping between GWL- and scenario-based responses in model analyses
>
> [CCB 11.1, Figure 3]
>
> To map scenario-based climate projections, first, all individual Earth system model (ESM) simulations that reach a certain GWL are identified. Second, the climate response patterns at that GWL are calculated using an approach termed **'GWL-sampling'** (or time sampling), which averages across all models and scenarios that reach the corresponding GWL. Mapping between scenarios/time frames and GWLs is used to assess the respective regional responses happening at these time frames.
>
> In the model-based assessments in this report, the estimation of changes at GWLs is generally defined as the **20-year time period** in which the mean global surface air temperature (GSAT) first exceeds a certain anomaly relative to 1850–1900.
>
> ### Mapping between GWL- and scenario-based responses for literature
>
> A large fraction of the literature uses scenario-based analyses for given time slices. As a rough approximation for mapping these studies, CMIP6 multi-model mean projections for the **near-term (2021–2040)** correspond to changes at about **$+1.5^{\circ}C$**, and projections for the **high-end scenario (SSP5-8.5)** for the **long-term (2081–2010)** correspond to about **$+4^{\circ}C$ to $+5^{\circ}C$** of global warming.
>
> ### GWLs versus scenarios
>
> The use of scenarios remains essential for informing mitigation decisions and for assessing variables that are strongly forcing-dependent (like aerosols) or time-dependent. For example, elements that are **quick to respond** to warming, like **sea ice area, permafrost, and snow**, show **little scenario dependence**. In contrast, **slow-responding variables** such as **ice volumes of glaciers and ice sheets** respond with a substantial delay; due to their inertia, their response **depends on the pathway** and when a certain GWL is reached.
>
> There is also a difference in the response even for temperature-related variables if a GWL is reached in a rapidly warming **transient state** versus a long-term **equilibrium state**, as the land-sea warming contrast is less pronounced in the latter. However, in this Report, GWLs are used in the context of 21st-century projections where the climate response is mostly transient and less dependent on the pathway than for projections beyond 2100.


# FAQ

## How Do Changes In Climate Extremes Compare With Changes In Climate Averages?

The relationship between changes in extremes and changes in averages strongly depends on the variable. Changes in local surface **temperature extremes** closely follow the corresponding changes in local **average surface temperatures**. In contrast, changes in **precipitation extremes** (heavy precipitation) generally **do not follow** those in average precipitation, and can even move in the opposite direction.

These differences arise because the underlying **physical processes** differ drastically across regions and seasons. Climate change can also manifest differently for different **weather regimes**, leading to contrasting changes in average and extreme conditions.

Recent observations and model projections consistently show that changes in **precipitation extremes** differ drastically from those in **average precipitation**. The intensification of extreme precipitation is driven by the increase in **atmospheric water vapour** (following the C-C relation of about 7% per $1^{\circ}C$ of warming). In contrast, changes in *average* precipitation are constrained by slower processes (like the global energy budget) to only **2–3% per $1^{\circ}C$** of warming near the surface.

In summary, the specific relationship strongly depends on the phenomenon. At the local scale, average and extreme **temperature changes are strongly related**, while average and extreme **precipitation changes are weakly related**. For both variables, the changes vary strongly across different places due to local and regional processes.

## Did Climate Change Cause That Recent Extreme Event In My Country?

The science of **event attribution** enables scientists to attribute aspects of specific extreme weather and climate events to certain causes. A common question is whether a particular event was *caused* by climate change. Scientists cannot answer this directly, as extremes do occur naturally and any single event is a complex mix of human and natural factors. Instead, scientists **quantify the relative importance** of human and natural influences on the **magnitude and/or probability** of specific extreme weather events.

On a case-by-case basis, scientists can now quantify the contribution of human influence to many extreme events. This is done by estimating and comparing the probability or magnitude of the same type of event in two different worlds:
* The **current climate**, which includes increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and other human influences.
* A **counterfactual climate**, such as one where atmospheric greenhouse gases remained at pre-industrial levels.

The change in the magnitude and/or probability of the event between these two scenarios is then attributed to **human influence**.

As the climate continues to warm, larger changes in probability and magnitude are expected. As a result, it will be possible to attribute future temperature and precipitation extremes in many locations to human influences with even greater confidence.
