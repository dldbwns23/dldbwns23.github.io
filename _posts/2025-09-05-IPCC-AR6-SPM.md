## 1. A Deeper Look at the IPCC AR6 Report: The Physical Science of a Changing Climate

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the physical science of climate change. This post synthesizes the key findings from the Summary for Policymakers of the Working Group I contribution, offering a detailed look at the current state of our climate, a range of potential futures based on emissions scenarios, and the physical basis for climate action.

### Key Terminology

To understand the report's findings, it's essential to be familiar with its specific terminology:
* **Likelihood & Confidence:** The report uses calibrated language to express certainty. **Likelihood** refers to a probabilistic estimate (e.g., *virtually certain* for 99–100% probability; *very likely* for 90–100%; *likely* for 66–100%), while **confidence** is a qualitative measure of a finding's validity (*very high*, *high*, *medium*, *low*).
* **Emissions Scenarios (SSPx-y):** The report uses five illustrative scenarios to explore future climate outcomes. 'SSPx' refers to the underlying socio-economic pathway, and '-y' refers to the approximate level of radiative forcing (in W/m²) in the year 2100. They range from very low (SSP1-1.9) to very high (SSP5-8.5).
* **Climatic Impact-Drivers (CIDs):** These are physical climate conditions—such as heat, cold, floods, and droughts—that directly affect human societies and ecosystems.
* **Carbon Budget:** This is the maximum cumulative amount of net anthropogenic CO2 that can be emitted globally to limit warming to a specific level (e.g., 1.5°C) with a given probability. It is the scientific basis for understanding how much more CO2 the world can emit.

## 2. The Current State of the Climate

### 2.1 An Unequivocal Human Influence

The report begins with its most direct assertion: it is *unequivocal* that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, leading to widespread and rapid changes.

* **Temperature Rise:** The global surface temperature in 2011–2020 was **1.09°C higher** than the 1850–1900 average, with larger increases over land (1.59°C) than the ocean (0.88°C). This warming has accelerated, with the period since 2003 alone contributing +0.19°C to the total increase since the AR5 report.
* **Cryosphere Changes:** Human influence is *very likely* the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area. However, there has been no significant trend in **Antarctic** sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 due to opposing regional trends.
* **Sea Level Rise:** Global mean sea level increased by **0.20 meters** between 1901 and 2018. The rate of this rise is accelerating, increasing from 1.3 mm/yr (1901–1971) to **3.7 mm/yr** (2006–2018) (*high confidence*).

### 2.2 Unprecedented Modern Changes

The scale of these recent changes is unprecedented when viewed in a long-term context.
* In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than at any time in at least **2 million years** (*high confidence*).
* The global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the **last 2000 years** (*high confidence*).
* The annual average Arctic sea ice area from 2011–2020 reached its **lowest level since at least 1850** (*high confidence*).
* While ocean pH has changed over geological time, the current low levels are **unusual in the last 2 million years** (*medium confidence*).

### 2.3 Intensification of Extreme Weather

Human-induced climate change is already affecting weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.
* It is *virtually certain* that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and intense across most land regions since the 1950s. It is also *high confidence* that human-induced climate change is the main driver of these changes.
* The frequency and intensity of **heavy precipitation events** have increased over most land areas since the 1950s (*high confidence*), and human influence is the *likely* main driver.
* It is *likely* that the global proportion of **major tropical cyclones (Category 3-5)** has increased over the last four decades. While data limitations inhibit clear detection of past frequency trends, it is *high confidence* that human-induced climate change increases the heavy precipitation associated with these storms.

### 2.4 Understanding the Drivers of Warming

Improved knowledge confirms that increased radiative forcing is heating the climate system. Ocean warming accounts for **91% of the total heating**, with land warming (~5%), ice loss (~3%), and atmospheric warming (~1%) accounting for the rest (*high confidence*). This heating is the direct cause of global mean sea level rise, driven by two primary mechanisms:
1.  **Thermal Expansion:** Warmer water expands. This process explained 50% of sea level rise between 1971–2018.
2.  **Ice Loss:** Melting glaciers and ice sheets add water to the ocean. The rate of ice-sheet loss **increased by a factor of four** between 1992–1999 and 2010–2019, and ice loss from both ice sheets and glaciers was the dominant contributor to sea level rise from 2006–2018 (*high confidence*).

The report's best estimate for **equilibrium climate sensitivity**—the long-term warming expected from a doubling of CO2—is **3°C**, with a *likely* range of 2.5°C to 4°C.

## 3. Possible Climate Futures

### 3.1 Projected Warming Across Scenarios

Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least mid-century under all emissions scenarios considered. Global warming of **1.5°C and 2°C will be exceeded** this century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades. It is important to note that the occurrence of a single year with a temperature change above 1.5°C does not imply this warming level has been permanently reached, as natural variability causes year-to-year fluctuations.

### 3.2 Impacts Scale with Warming

Many changes in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming. This includes more frequent and intense hot extremes, marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and agricultural droughts.
* It is *virtually certain* that land will continue to warm more than the ocean and that the **Arctic will continue to warm at more than twice the global rate** (*high confidence*).
* Under all scenarios, the Arctic is *likely* to be practically sea ice-free in September at least once before 2050. In contrast, there is *low confidence* in projected decreases in Antarctic sea ice.

### 3.3 Changes to the Global Water Cycle

Continued warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, increasing its variability and the severity of wet and dry events.
* Precipitation is projected to **increase** over high latitudes, the equatorial Pacific, and parts of the monsoon regions but **decrease** over parts of the subtropics (*very likely*).
* A warmer climate will intensify very wet and dry seasons, leading to more flooding and droughts (*high confidence*).
* Mid-latitude storm tracks in the Southern Hemisphere are *likely* to shift southward in the long term under high-emissions scenarios.

### 3.4 Carbon Cycle Feedbacks and Irreversible Changes

Under scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the ocean and land **carbon sinks are projected to be less effective** at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. While they will absorb more CO2 in absolute terms, the *proportion* of emissions they take up will decrease.

Crucially, many changes from past and future emissions are **irreversible for centuries to millennia**, especially changes in the ocean, ice sheets, and global sea level.

## 4. Climate Information for Risk Assessment

### 4.1 Regional Variability and Compounding Risks

Natural drivers and internal variability will continue to modulate human-caused changes, especially at regional scales and in the near term. This means that with further global warming, every region is projected to experience **concurrent and multiple changes** in climatic impact-drivers (CIDs). These changes will be more widespread at 2°C than at 1.5°C.

Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of **compound events** with higher global warming (*high confidence*). Concurrent heatwaves and droughts, for example, are *likely* to become more frequent. Due to sea level rise, extreme sea level events that were once rare (e.g., once-a-century) are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 (*high confidence*).

### 4.2 Low-Likelihood, High-Impact Outcomes

**Low-likelihood outcomes cannot be ruled out** and are a critical part of risk assessment. These include events like an Antarctic ice-sheet collapse, abrupt ocean circulation changes, or warming substantially larger than the *very likely* range. The probability of these high-impact events increases with higher global warming levels.

## 5. Limiting Future Climate Change

### 5.1 The Centrality of Cumulative CO2

From a physical science perspective, limiting human-induced global warming requires **limiting cumulative CO2 emissions**. The report reaffirms a near-linear relationship between total cumulative CO2 emissions and the global warming they cause. This implies two key points:
1.  To stabilize global temperature at any level, **net-zero anthropogenic CO2 emissions** must be reached.
2.  Limiting warming to a specific level means staying within a finite **carbon budget**.

Reductions in other emissions are also critical. Strong, rapid reductions in methane (CH4), for example, would help limit near-term warming and improve air quality by reducing surface ozone (*high confidence*).

{% endraw %}


### 5.2 The Discernible Effects of Mitigation

If the world pursues a path of very low GHG emissions (e.g., SSP1-1.9 or SSP1-2.6), the effects would become discernible above natural variability at different timescales:
* Changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations, and thus **air quality**, would be discernible **within years**.
* Differences in **global surface temperature trends** would **likely** emerge from the noise of natural variability **within around 20 years**.

By the end of the century, low-emission scenarios would strongly limit changes in many CIDs, including the frequency of extreme sea level events, heavy precipitation, and dangerous heat thresholds (*high confidence*). However, even if global net-negative CO2 emissions are achieved, some changes, like sea level rise, would continue their upward trajectory for centuries to millennia (*high confidence*).

## Overview

The latest IPCC report states with absolute certainty that human activities have unequivocally warmed our planet, driving the widespread and rapid changes we see today. These changes aren't subtle; we're witnessing unprecedented heatwaves, accelerating sea-level rise, and the rapid retreat of glaciers and Arctic sea ice on a scale not seen in thousands of years. Looking ahead, the science is clear: the severity of our future climate depends directly on the emissions choices we make now. Every fraction of a degree of additional warming will further intensify extremes like heavy rainfall, droughts, and the proportion of intense tropical cyclones.

Crucially, many of these impacts, especially to our oceans and ice sheets, are irreversible for centuries to millennia, locking in future sea-level rise regardless of our near-term actions. From a physical science perspective, the path to stabilizing the climate is unambiguous: we must limit our total cumulative CO2 emissions. This means staying within a finite carbon budget and ultimately reaching net-zero CO2 emissions to stop any further temperature increase. While some changes are locked in, the report shows that deep, rapid emissions cuts would have discernible benefits for temperature trends within about two decades and for air quality almost immediately.
