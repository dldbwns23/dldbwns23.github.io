To detect the *anthropogenic fingerprints* within observed climate change, researchers typically compare results derived from climate models with real-world observations. This comparative approach aims to robustly establish that greenhouse gas emissions stemming from human activities are the primary contributors to global warming. Furthermore, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as heavy rainfall and heatwaves, necessitate precise detection and attribution studies. Such efforts are crucial for understanding the causes of specific climate changes and for making more accurate predictions of future climate evolution based on these insights.

The scientific community identifies the anthropogenic fingerprint on climate change by systematically comparing climate model simulations with observational data. According to Figure 1, current global warming trends and patterns can only be accurately replicated by models when human-induced forcings (such as greenhouse gas emissions) are included in their simulations. Conversely, models that consider only natural forcings (like volcanic activity or solar variations) consistently fail to reproduce the observed warming, particularly the rapid and widespread changes seen since the mid-20th century. This discrepancy strongly indicates that human activities are the dominant driver of recent climate change.
